# LOAN-ELIGIBILITY-PREDICTION
Loans are fundamental to the banks' operations. The principal profit is directly derived from the interest of the loan. After an exhaustive verification and validation procedure the loan firms provide a loan. However, if the borrower can return the loan without any issues, it still has no guarantee. Creating a predictive model in this project to detect if the applicant can reimburse the lenders or not. We prepare the data using Jupyter notebooks to forecast the target variable using several models. This project has been implemented using Machine learning techniques using Linear Regression with an accuracy of 80 percent. 

 AIM AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
In our country there is a shortage of surveillance systems due to high cost. To overcome this shortage we came up with this technique.The main goal is to predict if the person can repay the loan or not.

MODULES OVERVIEW:

Module is a logical separation of functionality within a project. They are basically used for reusability and better code maintenance. There are nine modules used here,
Data Cleaning
Feature engineering
Model Training
